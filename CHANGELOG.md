## [0.1.0-beta.1] — 2026-06-05

First public beta.

### Added

- Evidence ingestion: E01/EX01/S01, VHD/VHDX (KAPE `--vhd`), and raw `dd` images
  via The Sleuth Kit; loose KAPE/triage folders read directly off disk.
- Self-contained, vendored TSK + libyal toolchain (`libevtx`, `libregf`) built
  from source — no Homebrew or other runtime dependencies.
- Multi-host `.strata` case bundles with a recent-cases list.
- File-system enumeration (`tsk_loaddb` → SQLite via GRDB); recursive walk for
  loose folders.
- MACB timeline with a drag-to-select histogram and gap analysis (quiet periods
  and activity sessions).
- Windows event log (`.evtx`) and registry-hive parsing, projected into a typed
  host profile.
- 15 detection analyzers emitting ATT&CK-tagged findings into a Cyber Kill Chain
  view.
- IOC matching for IPs, domains, URLs, and hashes.
- Interactive lateral-movement graph: pan, zoom, drag nodes, and an optional
  force-directed layout.

### Known limitations

- Apple Silicon (arm64) only.
- Loose-folder timelines use collection-host timestamps; `$MFT`-based MACB is
  pending.
- `$FILE_NAME` timestamps / timestomping detection not yet implemented.
- No YARA or known-bad hashing yet.
